# Mux Video Live Stream Input Health Event Stream

Mux can now stream livestream health and metadata events for customers to an Amazon Kinesis endpoint in the customerâ€™s cloud account. This feature is currently in closed beta for customers interested in testing the feature.

`LiveStreamInputHealth` events are sent to Kinesis as they are emitted and are made available to customers to retrieve from the stream within about one minute. Each `LiveStreamInputHealth` event will contain details for either a `RTMPMetadataEvent` or `HealthUpdateEvent`. Protobuf definitions for consuming the livestream input health events are in `proto/v1/livestreaminputhealth_v1.proto`.

This spec also supports Google Pub/Sub Schema requirements ([here](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/schemas#schema_types)) for future consumption with Pub/Sub.
